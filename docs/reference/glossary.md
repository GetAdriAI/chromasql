## Sharded deployment

A sharded deployment refers to distributing a system across multiple independent instances (shards), where each instance handles a subset of the total data or workload.

Benefits:

* Scalability: Add more shards as you grow rather than upgrading one massive server
* Performance: Each shard handles less data, making queries faster
* Isolation: Issues in one shard don't necessarily affect others
